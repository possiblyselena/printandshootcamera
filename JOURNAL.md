## 10/5/2025 - Mind Map of my ideas  

I researched similar projects to see what they did. Many thermal print cameras use raspberry pis, adafruit thermal printer product and libraries, but they discontinued them AND it's really outdated. Quite recently, two creators have made thermal printers using the esp 32 module, and I'm going to be the 3rd! I made sure to read through their documentation about this project so I can understand what's going on and what I have to do, and then I made a vision board with all my requirements and materials I need.

## 10/6/2025 - Laid out my schematic and made my pcb!  

I researched more into parts, and applied them into the schematic! I asked for some help and clarification in #blueprint to know if I'm powering my components correctly. I'm only designing a PCB so I can connect stuff better, so I don't need to order an assembly, and all my components are modules. I had to design a custom symbol and footprint for my beak converter. I laid them out in the PCB editor, and next time I'll route them. But for now, I know what parts I'm using and put them in my BOM for reference.

It should look prettier by tomorrow, but I'm proud of myself for figuring this out.
