## 10/5/2025 - Mind Map of my ideas  

I researched similar projects to see what they did. Many thermal print cameras use raspberry pis, adafruit thermal printer product and libraries, but they discontinued them AND it's really outdated. Quite recently, two creators have made thermal printers using the esp 32 module, and I'm going to be the 3rd! I made sure to read through their documentation about this project so I can understand what's going on and what I have to do, and then I made a vision board with all my requirements and materials I need.
